To take advantage of all the latest features (such as Instant Run), improvements and security fixes, we strongly recommend that you update the Android Gradle plugin to version 3.0.0-beta7 and Gradle to version 4.1.  You can learn more about this version of the plugin from the release notes.

Gradle Sync Issues
    Error:Error:The specified Android SDK Build Tools version (25.0.2) is ignored, as it is below the minimum supported version (26.0.2) for Android Gradle Plugin 3.0.0-beta7.
Android SDK Build Tools 26.0.2 will be used.
To suppress this warning, remove "buildToolsVersion '25.0.2'" from your build.gradle file, as each version of the Android Gradle Plugin now has a default version of the build tools.

<<< Change compileSdkVersion from 25 to 26

3 errors:


	1. compileSdkVersion (25) should not be lower than targetSdkVersion (26)
	2. the support library 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.1.0' should not use a lower version than the targetSdkVersion
	3. the support library 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:25.1.0' should not use a lower version than the targetSdkVersion

There are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is compiling with a version of the Android support libraries that is not the latest version (or in particular, a version lower than your targetSdkVersion.) When using a compileSdkVersion android-O revision 2 or higher, the support library version should be 26.0.0-beta1 or higher (was 25.1.0)

          or use tools:overrideLibrary="android.support.v7.appcompat" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)
